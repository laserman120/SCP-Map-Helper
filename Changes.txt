Added the Info Menu, takes txt file and uses $ to break a line

12.05.23
Moved the room types into seperate json files. No longer inside the index.js
Adjusted the height of the info box to prevent text clipping over the buttons at the bottom.
Added spoiler checkmark to enable or disable further information on rooms
Adjusted margin of the bottom buttons to help in small window cases

13.05.23
Added setup for different game types
added check for the game version selected during a save
changed cell image type check to a switch

22.05.23
Added the option the move the highlight around with the arrow keys. This also allows for the creation of cells
Automatically highlight the search input whenever the card menu is open
First cell will be highlighted on start
Double klick while pressing control now deletes the targeted cell

23.05.23
When creating a new cell with the arrow keys, you can now hold down control to keep the highlight at the current position.
Reworked the right card menu, this no longer deletes and recreates itself each time. 
It is replaced by static buttons and search fields, which are no longer modified each time.
Instead the only thing that is modified are the images inside a new div, these are deleted and rendered again each time. Due to the way the insertion of images works i dont plan on only refreshing when it actually changes.
Making most parts static will hopefully allow for easier customization later on.
Still looks like shit

24.05.23
Its now possible for rooms to force adjacent rooms to be created, usefull in cases in which people "might" assume that there is no room adjacent as it is invisible.
Added enter to set the first image in the list, which is currently shown.

Maybe change the current approach? Replace the background image to set down a rough representation of the current room and add a logo for identification on top,
 this would make the layout of certain rooms clearer while keeping it easy to spot
