$ spoiler
A shadow of a woman is cast on the wall, displaying her in various suggestive poses. $
Eventually the image will change to display horned male figures idly standing around. 
Shortly after the figures will begin to attack the shadow woman until she dies.$

Upon any of the male figures appearing, the door to the chamber will open. $
Once the player enters the room all three figures will appear and stare at the player, followed by the doors closing and the lamps turning off. $
After the lights go out the figures will turn invisible and begin attacking the player until they die.
